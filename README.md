# Metabolomics--Practical--Guide
This book covers Metabolomics, the scientific study of the chemical processes of the metabolic system. It is based on a course taught to masters and postgraduate students of bioinformatics and statistics at the European Bioinformatics Institute at Cambridge, so the material has been class-tested and includes lots of examples, computing and exercises. Metabolomics is a relatively new omics science, but the potential applications are wide, including medicine, personalized medicine and interventions studies, food and nutrition, plants, agriculture and environmental science
