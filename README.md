# Metabolomics: Practical Guide to Design and Analysis
#### 1st Edition edited by _Ron Wehrens_ and _Reza Salek_

Metabolomics is the scientific study of the chemical processes in a living system, environment and nutrition. It is a relatively new omics science, but the potential applications are wide, including medicine, personalized medicine and intervention studies, food and nutrition, plants, agriculture and environmental science. The topics presented and discussed in this book are based on the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) practical courses in metabolomics bioinformatics taught to those working in the field, from masters to postgraduate students, PhDs, postdoctoral and early PIs. The book covers the basics and fundamentals of data acquisition and analytical technologies, but the primary focus is data handling and data analysis. The mentioning and usage of a particular data analysis tool has been avoided; rather, the focus is on the concepts and principles of data processing and analysis. The material has been class-tested and includes lots of examples, computing and exercises.
